# Lab 01 – Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

## Goal
Provision identities for a pre-production lab environment using Microsoft Entra ID and reduce administrative overhead with automated group membership.

## What I did
- Reviewed tenant basics and identity scope (tenant as the identity boundary for cloud services).
- Created and managed Entra ID user accounts (member vs guest concepts).
- Created groups (Security vs Microsoft 365 groups) to organize access.
- Implemented **dynamic group membership** based on user attributes (e.g., job title) to keep memberships up to date automatically.

## Key concepts practiced
- Tenant as an organizational boundary
- Member vs guest accounts
- Security groups vs Microsoft 365 groups
- Static vs dynamic group assignment

## Outcome
A baseline identity setup (users + groups) with dynamic group membership rules to reduce manual admin effort.
