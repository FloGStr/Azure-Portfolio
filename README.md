# Azure Portfolio (Hands-on)

This repository documents my hands-on Azure learning journey and lab implementations (AZ-104 level), focused on building solid cloud foundations: identity & governance, networking, IaC, compute, app platforms, monitoring and resiliency.

## Certifications
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-305)

## Focus Areas (high level)
- Identity & Governance: Entra ID basics, RBAC, Azure Policy
- Networking: VNet/subnetting, NSG/ASG, DNS, peering & routes
- Infrastructure as Code: ARM templates & Bicep
- Compute: VMs, VM Scale Sets, autoscaling
- App Platform: App Service (deployment slots), containers (ACI/ACA)
- Operations & Resilience: Azure Monitor alerts, Backup (RSV) & Site Recovery (ASR)
